# {{PROJECT_NAME}} — how this template builds and runs

> **Agent: read this before adding or moving files.** The `Dockerfile` — not
> convention — decides what ships and what runs.

**Stack:** Node 24 · **Workload:** worker (headless) · **No port, no domain, no
health endpoint.**

## What this is

A long-running background process — a queue consumer, scheduler, or stream
worker. There is no HTTP server and nothing to curl; its output is its **stdout
logs**. deploymill keeps it running and restarts it if it exits.

## What actually runs

```
CMD ["node", "src/index.js"]
```

`src/index.js` is **THE entrypoint**. Replace the placeholder heartbeat loop with
your real recurring work — but **keep the process alive** (an open timer, socket,
or loop). If the event loop drains, Node exits and the platform restarts it. Edit
`src/index.js` or import modules into it; don't add a parallel entrypoint unless
you change `CMD`.

## What ships into the image

| What | Path | Notes |
|------|------|-------|
| dependencies | `node_modules` | resolved from `package.json` at build (not committed) |
| manifest | `package.json` | declares deps + `"type": "module"` |
| your code | `src/` | everything here ships |

**Anything outside `src/` is NOT in the image.** Add a `COPY` line if you need
something else at runtime.

## File map

```

## Recipes

- **Do real work** → replace the `doWork()` heartbeat in `src/index.js` (poll a
  queue, run a sweep, consume a stream). Keep the keep-alive timer/loop.
- **Add a dependency** → add it to `dependencies` in `package.json`; the next
  deploy runs `pnpm install`. (This starter has none.)
- **Native (C/C++) addon dep** (`better-sqlite3`, `bcrypt`, `sharp`, …) → pnpm
  **skips dependency build scripts by default**, so an unguarded install goes green
  and then crash-loops at runtime with `Could not locate the bindings file`. Add the
  package to `pnpm.onlyBuiltDependencies` in `package.json` (`better-sqlite3` is
  already there). The build stage installs `python3 make g++` for packages that must
  compile from source. Prefer the built-in `node:sqlite` (no addon) when SQLite is all
  you need.
- **Handle shutdown** → the template already traps `SIGTERM` and exits cleanly;
  do your cleanup there (drain in-flight work, close connections) before exit.

## Adding a database or a volume

Add these when the worker needs to persist or read state. The platform
provisions the resource and **injects the connection as an env var** — you never
hardcode credentials.

- **Database** (`postgres` · `neon` · `supabase` · `sqlite`) → add to
  `.deploymill/project.json`, then `reconcile_project` and `deploy`:
  ```json
  "database": { "provider": "sqlite" }
  ```
  The worker reads **`process.env.DATABASE_URL`** — identical across providers.
  `sqlite` auto-provisions its own volume. The client (`pg`), pooling, and
  migration pattern are in **`deploymill://guides/database/node`** — but note
  that guide is written for a *web* app: its `/db` health route and
  health-gated deploy don't apply to a worker (no HTTP edge), so skip those and
  keep the library/pool/migration parts.
- **Persistent volume** → add a `mounts` entry, reconcile, deploy:
  ```json
  "mounts": [{ "volumeName": "data", "mountPath": "/data", "sizeGb": 10 }]
  ```
  Grow-only. See **`deploymill://guides/storage`**.

## Secrets & environment variables (API keys, third-party services)

When the worker needs config or a credential — an API key for the queue/service
it talks to, an OAuth secret, a feature flag — read it from **`process.env.X`**
(never hardcode, never commit a key). deploymill injects these two ways:

- **Non-secret config** (public IDs, feature flags, tuning) → `set_env_vars`
  (with `list_env_vars` / `delete_env_vars` to manage). A redeploy applies it.
- **Secrets** (API keys, tokens, OAuth client secrets) → the **vault hand-off**,
  so the value never passes through the agent or the logs: `request_secret`
  returns a browser link the human pastes the value into, then `bind_secret`
  exposes it to the worker as an env var. Org-scoped, so the same secret is
  reusable across apps. Full contract (incl. config-as-code via a `secrets` array
  in `project.json`): **`deploymill://guides/secrets`**.

Reaching out to third-party services needs **open egress** — available on a paid
tier; the free Explore floor keeps egress locked.

## Gotchas

- Runs as the non-root `node` user with Linux capabilities dropped — use a
  mounted volume for persistence, not the image filesystem.
- No port / no `EXPOSE` / no `/healthz` — this is intentional for a worker. If you
  actually need an HTTP endpoint, you want the **web** `node` template instead.
